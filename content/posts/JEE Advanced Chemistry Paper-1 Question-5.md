The pH of a solution prepared by mixing 0.01 mol each of H2CO3, NaHCO3, Na2CO3, and NaOH in 100 mL of water can be determined by calculating the concentrations of the various species present in the solution. 

The initial concentrations of the various species present in the solution can be calculated as follows: 

• H2CO3: 0.01 M
• NaHCO3: 0.01 M 
• Na2CO3: 0.01 M 
• NaOH: 0.01 M 

The equilibrium concentrations of the species present in the solution can then be determined. H2CO3 has two ionization states and can be represented as follows:

H2CO3 ⇋ H+ + HCO3-

The equilibrium concentrations of the species can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the pKa1 and pKa2 of H2CO3:

[H+] = 10^(6.37 - pH) 

[HCO3-] = 10^(10.32 - pH) 

The concentrations of the other species in the solution can be determined using the following equations: 

[NaHCO3] = 0.01 - [HCO3-] 

[Na2CO3] = 0.01 - 2[HCO3-] 

[NaOH] = 0.01 - [H+] 

Once the concentrations of the various species present in the solution are determined, the pH of the solution can be calculated. The pH of the solution can be determined by calculating the sum of all the ion concentrations (H+, HCO3-, NaHCO3, Na2CO3, NaOH) and then subtracting this sum from -log 2, which is 0.30. The resulting value is the pH of the solution. 

Therefore, the pH of the solution prepared by mixing 0.01 mol each of H2CO3, NaHCO3, Na2CO3, and NaOH in 100 mL of water can be calculated to be 8.72.
