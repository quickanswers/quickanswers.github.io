The electrochemical extraction of aluminum from bauxite ore involves the electrolysis of Al2O3 mixed with Na3AlF6 to give Al and CO2. This process is known as the Hall-HÃ©roult process.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:

1. Bauxite ore, which is a mixture of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and other minerals, is mined from the earth.

2. The bauxite ore is crushed and ground into a fine powder, called alumina.

3. The alumina is dissolved in hot aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form a solution called aluminate.

4. The aluminate solution is passed through an electrolytic cell, which consists of a cathode and an anode separated by a thin layer of molten electrolyte (Na3AlF6).

5. At the cathode, aluminum ions (Al3+) are reduced to metallic aluminum. This reaction is exothermic, releasing heat.

6. At the anode, oxygen ions (O2-) are oxidized to oxygen gas (O2). This reaction is endothermic, absorbing heat.

7. The metallic aluminum is collected at the cathode, while the oxygen gas is released at the anode.

8. The electrolysis process is continuous, with the aluminate solution being fed into the cell and the aluminum and oxygen products being removed.

Overall, the electrochemical extraction of aluminum from bauxite ore involves the electrolysis of Al2O3 mixed with Na3AlF6 to give Al and CO2, as stated in option (D).
