To solve this problem, we can use the concept of molality, which is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solvent. The molality of a solution is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.

In this case, the molality of the solution is 0.1 mol/1.8 kg = 0.0556 mol/kg. Since the salt remains 90% dissociated in the solution, this means that 0.9 × 0.1 mol = 0.09 mol of the salt are dissociated into ions.

We can use the molality of the solution and the vapor pressure of the solution to calculate the molality of the ions using the following equation:

ΔP = Kb × m
59.724 mm Hg = Kb × 0.0556 mol/kg
Kb = 59.724 mm Hg / 0.0556 mol/kg = 1069.8 mm Hg/mol

where ΔP is the change in vapor pressure, Kb is the molal boiling point elevation constant for water, and m is the molality of the solution.

We can use the value of Kb to calculate the molality of the ions in the solution:

ΔP = Kb × m
60.000 mm Hg - 59.724 mm Hg = Kb × m_ions
0.276 mm Hg = Kb × m_ions
m_ions = 0.276 mm Hg / 1069.8 mm Hg/mol = 0.000257 mol/kg

Since the molality of the ions is equal to 0.000257 mol/kg, and there are 0.09 mol of ions in 1.8 kg of water, this means that there are 0.000257 mol/kg × 1.8 kg = 0.000461 mol of ions in the solution.

Since the number of ions per formula unit of the ionic salt is equal to the number of ions in the solution divided by the number of moles of salt in the solution, we can calculate the number of ions per formula unit as follows:

0.000461 mol of ions / 0.1 mol of salt = 4.61 ions/formula unit

Therefore, the number of ions present per formula unit of the ionic salt is 4.61.
