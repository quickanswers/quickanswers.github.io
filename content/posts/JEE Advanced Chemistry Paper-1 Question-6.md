To solve this problem, you need to first determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between Cu(NO3)2 and KI. You can do this by examining the reactants and products and considering the types of ions present.

The reactants are Cu(NO3)2 and KI, which contain the ions Cu2+, NO3-, K+, and I-. The products are a brown solution and a precipitate. The brown solution likely contains Cu2+ ions, and the precipitate likely contains I- ions.

The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between Cu(NO3)2 and KI is:

Cu(NO3)2 + 2KI → CuI2 + 2KNO3

The CuI2 is a brown precipitate and the KNO3 is a soluble salt, which forms the brown solution.

Next, you need to consider the reaction between the brown solution and H2S. The brown solution contains Cu2+ ions and K+ ions, and the H2S gas contains H+ ions and S2- ions.

The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between the brown solution and H2S is:

Cu2+ + S2- + H+ → CuS + H2O

The CuS is a black precipitate, which is the compound X.

To determine the amount of X in grams, you need to first determine the number of moles of X produced. You can do this by using the balanced chemical equation and the given information about the amount of Cu(NO3)2 used in the reaction.

From the balanced chemical equation, you can see that for every mole of Cu(NO3)2 used, one mole of CuS is produced. Therefore, the number of moles of CuS produced is equal to the number of moles of Cu(NO3)2 used.

The number of moles of Cu(NO3)2 used can be calculated using the given mass of Cu(NO3)2 and its molar mass:

number of moles of Cu(NO3)2 = 3.74 g / (117.61 g/mol) = 0.0318 moles

The mass of X can then be calculated using the number of moles of X and its molar mass:

mass of X = 0.0318 moles * 160.61 g/mol = 5.12 g

Therefore, the amount of X in grams is approximately 5.12 g.
