a step-by-step solution:

Draw a diagram of the given configuration.

Consider one of the smaller circles, say 𝐺𝑖. Since it touches 𝐺 externally, we have 𝑟 + 𝑅 = d, where d is the distance between the centers of 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺.

Now consider the two circles 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺𝑖+1. Since they also touch each other externally, we have 𝑟 + 𝑟 = d', where d' is the distance between the centers of 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺𝑖+1.

We can express d' in terms of d as follows: d' = d + 2𝑟, since the distance between the centers of two circles that touch externally is equal to the sum of their radii.

Using this relationship, we can express the distance between the centers of 𝐺1 and 𝐺𝑛 as follows:
d'' = d + 2𝑟 + d' + 2𝑟 + ... + d + 2𝑟 = (𝑛 − 1)d + 2𝑛𝑟.

Since 𝐺1 and 𝐺𝑛 also touch each other externally, we have 𝑟 + 𝑟 = d'', which implies that (𝑛 − 1)d + 2𝑛𝑟 = 2𝑟.

Solving this equation for d, we get d = 2𝑟/(𝑛 − 1).

Substituting this expression for d into the equation d = 𝑟 + 𝑅, we get 𝑅 = 2𝑟/(𝑛 − 1) − 𝑟.

Now we can use this expression to determine which of the statements (A), (B), (C), and (D) is/are true.

For (A), we have 𝑛 = 4, so 𝑅 = 2𝑟/(4 − 1) − 𝑟 = 𝑟. This means that (√2 − 1)𝑟 = 𝑟, which is not true, so (A) is false.

For (B), we have 𝑛 = 5, so 𝑅 = 2𝑟/(5 − 1) − 𝑟 = 𝑟/2. This means that 𝑟 < 𝑅, which is true, so (B) is true.

For (C), we have 𝑛 = 8, so 𝑅 = 2𝑟/(8 − 1) − 𝑟 = 𝑟/3. This means that (√2 − 1)𝑟 = 𝑟/3, which is not true, so (C) is false.

For (D), we have 𝑛 = 12, so 𝑅 = 2𝑟/(12 − 1) − 𝑟 = 𝑟/5. This means that √2 (√3 + 1) 𝑟 = 𝑟/5, which is not true, so (D) is false.
