To solve this problem, we can use the solubility equilibrium expression for PbSO4:

[Pb2+][SO4^2-] = Ksp

We can also use the dissociation constants for sulfuric acid to write the equilibrium expressions for H2SO4 and SO4^2-:

H2SO4 <=> H^+ + HSO4^-
Ka1 = [H^+][HSO4^-]/[H2SO4]

HSO4^- <=> H^+ + SO4^2-
Ka2 = [H^+][SO4^2-]/[HSO4^-]

We know that the concentration of H2SO4 is 1 M, and the concentration of Na2SO4 is 1.8 × 10^-2 M. We can assume that the concentration of Na+ ions is equal to the concentration of Na2SO4, since Na2SO4 is a strong electrolyte and completely dissociates in solution.

We can also assume that the concentration of H+ ions is equal to the concentration of Na+ ions, since they are both monovalent and the solution is neutral.

We can then substitute these values into the equilibrium expressions for H2SO4 and SO4^2- to solve for the concentrations of H^+ and SO4^2-:

[H^+] = 1.8 × 10^-2 M
[HSO4^-] = [H^+]/Ka2 = 1.8 × 10^-2 M/1.2 × 10^-2 = 1.5 M
[H2SO4] = 1 M - [HSO4^-] = 1 M - 1.5 M = -0.5 M (note that this is a negative concentration, which is not physically possible)

[SO4^2-] = [H^+]/Ka2 = 1.8 × 10^-2 M/1.2 × 10^-2 = 1.5 M

We can now substitute these values into the solubility equilibrium expression for PbSO4 to solve for the molar solubility of PbSO4:

[Pb2+][SO4^2-] = Ksp
X × 10^-Y [1.5 M] = 1.6 × 10^-8
X = 1.6 × 10^-8 / (1.5 M) = 1.07 × 10^-8 M
Y = 8

Therefore, the molar solubility of PbSO4 in the solution is 1.07 × 10^-8 M, and the value of Y is 8.
