The correct statement(s) about polymers is (A) The polymerization of chloroprene gives natural rubber, and (D) Ethene at 350-570 K temperature and 1000-2000 atm pressure in the presence of a peroxide initiator yields high density polythene.

The polymerization of chloroprene (2-chlorobutadiene) does indeed give natural rubber, which is a type of elastomer. This process involves the addition polymerization of chloroprene monomers to form a polymer with a cis-1,4 configuration.

Ethene (ethylene) can also be polymerized to form high density polyethylene (HDPE) using a peroxide initiator at high temperatures and pressures. HDPE is a type of thermoplastic polymer that is characterized by its high strength and toughness.

Option (B) Teflon is prepared from tetrafluoroethene by heating it with persulphate catalyst at high pressures is incorrect. Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE) is actually prepared by the polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene using a free radical initiator, such as a peroxide. This process typically occurs at relatively low pressures.

Option (C) PVC are thermoplastic polymers is correct. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a type of thermoplastic polymer that is made by the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomers.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
