Therefore, the enthalpy change of any reaction can be calculated by adding the enthalpy changes of the individual reactions which make up the overall reaction.\nIn this case, the reaction of combustion of Hg(g) to form HgO(s) can be broken down into two individual reactions as follows:\nReaction 1: Hg(g) → Hg(g) + 0.5O2(g) Reaction 2: 0.5O2(g) + Hg(g) → HgO(s)\nThe enthalpy change of the overall reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes of the two individual reactions. Thus,\nΔHrxn = ΔH1 + ΔH2\nThe enthalpy change of the first reaction (ΔH1) can be calculated using the following equation:\nΔH1 = nHfHg(g) – [nHfHg(g) + 0.5 nHfO2(g)]\nwhere nHfHg(g) and nHfO2(g) are the standard molar enthalpy of formation of Hg(g) and O2(g) at 298 K respectively.\nFor the second reaction (ΔH2), the heat of combustion of HgO(s) can be calculated using the following equation:\nΔH2 = (nCcal) (ΔT) + nHfHgO(s)\nwhere nCcal is the heat capacity of the calorimeter, ΔT is the temperature rise, and nHfHgO(s) is the standard molar enthalpy of formation of HgO(s) at 298 K.\nSubstituting the given values in the above equations, we get:\nΔH1 = 61.32 kJ mol-1 – [61.32 kJ mol-1 + (0.5)(0)] = 61.32 kJ mol-1\nΔH2 = (20.00 kJ K-1)(312.8 K – 298.0 K) + X kJ mol-1 = (20.00 kJ K-1)(14.8 K) + X kJ mol-1 = 296.0 kJ + X kJ mol-1\nTherefore, the enthalpy change of the overall reaction (ΔHrxn) is given by:\nΔHrxn = ΔH1 + ΔH2 = 61.32 kJ mol-1 + 296.0 kJ + X kJ mol-1 = 357.32 kJ + X kJ mol-1\nTherefore, X = –357.32 kJ mol-1. Thus, the standard molar enthalpy of formation of HgO(s) at 298 K is –357.32 kJ mol-1.\n","permalink":"https://quickanswer.site/posts/jee-advanced-chemistry-paper-1-question-4/","summary":"The standard molar enthalpy of formation of HgO(s) at 298 K (X) can be calculated using Hess\u0026rsquo;s law of constant heat summation. This law states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is independent of the pathway taken to reach the reaction. Therefore, the enthalpy change of any reaction can be calculated by adding the enthalpy changes of the individual reactions which make up the overall reaction.\nIn this case, the reaction of combustion of Hg(g) to form HgO(s) can be broken down into two individual reactions as follows:","title":"JEE Advanced Chemistry Paper-1 | Question-4 | Detailed Solution"},{"content":"You can contact us here!\nName* Email* Subject* Message Send ","permalink":"https://quickanswer.site/contact/","summary":"You can contact us here!\nName* Email* Subject* Message Send ","title":"Contact"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://quickanswer.site/thankyou/","summary":"","title":"Thank you"}]
