      <description>The standard molar enthalpy of formation of HgO(s) at 298 K (X) can be calculated using Hess&amp;rsquo;s law of constant heat summation. This law states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is independent of the pathway taken to reach the reaction. Therefore, the enthalpy change of any reaction can be calculated by adding the enthalpy changes of the individual reactions which make up the overall reaction.
In this case, the reaction of combustion of Hg(g) to form HgO(s) can be broken down into two individual reactions as follows:</description>
