      <description>a step-by-step solution:
Draw a diagram of the given configuration.
Consider one of the smaller circles, say 𝐺𝑖. Since it touches 𝐺 externally, we have 𝑟 + 𝑅 = d, where d is the distance between the centers of 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺.
Now consider the two circles 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺𝑖+1. Since they also touch each other externally, we have 𝑟 + 𝑟 = d&amp;rsquo;, where d&amp;rsquo; is the distance between the centers of 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺𝑖+1.</description>

      <description>In this problem, we are given two arithmetic progressions with common differences d1 and d2, respectively. The nth term of the first arithmetic progression is ln = l1 + (n-1)d1, and the nth term of the second arithmetic progression is wn = w1 + (n-1)d2. We are also told that the area of the rectangle with length ln and width wn is An = ln * wn.
Our goal is to find the value of A100 - A90, given that A51 - A50 = 1000 and d1d2 = 10.</description>
