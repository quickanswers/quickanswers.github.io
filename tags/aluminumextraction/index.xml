      <description>The electrochemical extraction of aluminum from bauxite ore involves the electrolysis of Al2O3 mixed with Na3AlF6 to give Al and CO2. This process is known as the Hall-HÃ©roult process.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a step-by-step explanation of the process:
Bauxite ore, which is a mixture of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and other minerals, is mined from the earth.
The bauxite ore is crushed and ground into a fine powder, called alumina.
The alumina is dissolved in hot aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form a solution called aluminate.</description>
