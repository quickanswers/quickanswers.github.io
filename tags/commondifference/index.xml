      <description>In this problem, we are given two arithmetic progressions with common differences d1 and d2, respectively. The nth term of the first arithmetic progression is ln = l1 + (n-1)d1, and the nth term of the second arithmetic progression is wn = w1 + (n-1)d2. We are also told that the area of the rectangle with length ln and width wn is An = ln * wn.
Our goal is to find the value of A100 - A90, given that A51 - A50 = 1000 and d1d2 = 10.</description>
