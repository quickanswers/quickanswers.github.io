      <description>a step-by-step solution:
Draw a diagram of the given configuration.
Consider one of the smaller circles, say 𝐺𝑖. Since it touches 𝐺 externally, we have 𝑟 + 𝑅 = d, where d is the distance between the centers of 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺.
Now consider the two circles 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺𝑖+1. Since they also touch each other externally, we have 𝑟 + 𝑟 = d&amp;rsquo;, where d&amp;rsquo; is the distance between the centers of 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺𝑖+1.</description>

      <description>The equation we are given can be written as:
𝑥𝑑𝑦−(𝑦2−4𝑦)𝑑𝑥=0
This is a first-order linear differential equation and can be solved using the integrating factor method. The integrating factor is 𝑚=e^(∫𝑥𝑑𝑥)=e^(x^2/2).
We multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor to get:
e^(x^2/2)𝑥𝑑𝑦−e^(x^2/2)(𝑦2−4𝑦)𝑑𝑥=0
Now, we can integrate both sides of the equation to get:
∫e^(x^2/2)𝑥𝑑𝑦−∫e^(x^2/2)(𝑦2−4𝑦)𝑑𝑥=C
After integration, we get:
e^(x^2/2)y - 1/2e^(x^2/2)*(y^2 - 4y) = C
Now, we can use the initial condition y(1) = 2 to solve for the constant C.</description>

      <description>In this problem, we are given two arithmetic progressions with common differences d1 and d2, respectively. The nth term of the first arithmetic progression is ln = l1 + (n-1)d1, and the nth term of the second arithmetic progression is wn = w1 + (n-1)d2. We are also told that the area of the rectangle with length ln and width wn is An = ln * wn.
Our goal is to find the value of A100 - A90, given that A51 - A50 = 1000 and d1d2 = 10.</description>

      <description>In this problem, we are given data about the symptoms of 900 persons in a study about a pandemic. Our goal is to find the probability that a randomly chosen person has at most one symptom.
To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle states that if we have a group of people with multiple characteristics, we can find the number of people with a certain combination of characteristics by adding the number of people with each characteristic separately, then subtracting the number of people with any pair of characteristics, then adding back the number of people with any triple of characteristics, and so on.</description>

      <description>In this problem, we are given the equation z^-1 - z^3 = i(z^-1 + z^3) and asked to find the number of distinct roots of this equation in the set of complex numbers.
To solve this equation, we can start by multiplying both sides by z:
z*(z^-1 - z^2) = i(z*(z^-1 + z^2)).
This simplifies to:
z^-1 - z^3 = i(z^-1 + z^3).
We can then multiply both sides by z^3:</description>
