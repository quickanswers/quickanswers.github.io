      <description>a step-by-step solution:
Draw a diagram of the given configuration.
Consider one of the smaller circles, say 𝐺𝑖. Since it touches 𝐺 externally, we have 𝑟 + 𝑅 = d, where d is the distance between the centers of 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺.
Now consider the two circles 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺𝑖+1. Since they also touch each other externally, we have 𝑟 + 𝑟 = d&amp;rsquo;, where d&amp;rsquo; is the distance between the centers of 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺𝑖+1.</description>

      <description>The equation we are given can be written as:
𝑥𝑑𝑦−(𝑦2−4𝑦)𝑑𝑥=0
This is a first-order linear differential equation and can be solved using the integrating factor method. The integrating factor is 𝑚=e^(∫𝑥𝑑𝑥)=e^(x^2/2).
We multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor to get:
e^(x^2/2)𝑥𝑑𝑦−e^(x^2/2)(𝑦2−4𝑦)𝑑𝑥=0
Now, we can integrate both sides of the equation to get:
∫e^(x^2/2)𝑥𝑑𝑦−∫e^(x^2/2)(𝑦2−4𝑦)𝑑𝑥=C
After integration, we get:
e^(x^2/2)y - 1/2e^(x^2/2)*(y^2 - 4y) = C
Now, we can use the initial condition y(1) = 2 to solve for the constant C.</description>

      <description>The correct statement(s) about polymers is (A) The polymerization of chloroprene gives natural rubber, and (D) Ethene at 350-570 K temperature and 1000-2000 atm pressure in the presence of a peroxide initiator yields high density polythene.
The polymerization of chloroprene (2-chlorobutadiene) does indeed give natural rubber, which is a type of elastomer. This process involves the addition polymerization of chloroprene monomers to form a polymer with a cis-1,4 configuration.
Ethene (ethylene) can also be polymerized to form high density polyethylene (HDPE) using a peroxide initiator at high temperatures and pressures.</description>

      <description>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of molality, which is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solvent. The molality of a solution is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.
In this case, the molality of the solution is 0.1 mol/1.8 kg = 0.0556 mol/kg. Since the salt remains 90% dissociated in the solution, this means that 0.9 × 0.</description>

      <description>To solve this problem, we can use the solubility equilibrium expression for PbSO4:
[Pb2+][SO4^2-] = Ksp
We can also use the dissociation constants for sulfuric acid to write the equilibrium expressions for H2SO4 and SO4^2-:
H2SO4 &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; H^+ + HSO4^- Ka1 = [H^+][HSO4^-]/[H2SO4]
HSO4^- &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; H^+ + SO4^2- Ka2 = [H^+][SO4^2-]/[HSO4^-]
We know that the concentration of H2SO4 is 1 M, and the concentration of Na2SO4 is 1.8 × 10^-2 M.</description>
