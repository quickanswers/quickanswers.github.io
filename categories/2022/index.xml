      <description>a step-by-step solution:
Draw a diagram of the given configuration.
Consider one of the smaller circles, say 𝐺𝑖. Since it touches 𝐺 externally, we have 𝑟 + 𝑅 = d, where d is the distance between the centers of 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺.
Now consider the two circles 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺𝑖+1. Since they also touch each other externally, we have 𝑟 + 𝑟 = d&amp;rsquo;, where d&amp;rsquo; is the distance between the centers of 𝐺𝑖 and 𝐺𝑖+1.</description>

      <description>The equation we are given can be written as:
𝑥𝑑𝑦−(𝑦2−4𝑦)𝑑𝑥=0
This is a first-order linear differential equation and can be solved using the integrating factor method. The integrating factor is 𝑚=e^(∫𝑥𝑑𝑥)=e^(x^2/2).
We multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor to get:
e^(x^2/2)𝑥𝑑𝑦−e^(x^2/2)(𝑦2−4𝑦)𝑑𝑥=0
Now, we can integrate both sides of the equation to get:
∫e^(x^2/2)𝑥𝑑𝑦−∫e^(x^2/2)(𝑦2−4𝑦)𝑑𝑥=C
After integration, we get:
e^(x^2/2)y - 1/2e^(x^2/2)*(y^2 - 4y) = C
Now, we can use the initial condition y(1) = 2 to solve for the constant C.</description>

      <description>In this problem, we are given two arithmetic progressions with common differences d1 and d2, respectively. The nth term of the first arithmetic progression is ln = l1 + (n-1)d1, and the nth term of the second arithmetic progression is wn = w1 + (n-1)d2. We are also told that the area of the rectangle with length ln and width wn is An = ln * wn.
Our goal is to find the value of A100 - A90, given that A51 - A50 = 1000 and d1d2 = 10.</description>

      <description>In this problem, we are given data about the symptoms of 900 persons in a study about a pandemic. Our goal is to find the probability that a randomly chosen person has at most one symptom.
To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle states that if we have a group of people with multiple characteristics, we can find the number of people with a certain combination of characteristics by adding the number of people with each characteristic separately, then subtracting the number of people with any pair of characteristics, then adding back the number of people with any triple of characteristics, and so on.</description>

      <description>In this problem, we are given the equation z^-1 - z^3 = i(z^-1 + z^3) and asked to find the number of distinct roots of this equation in the set of complex numbers.
To solve this equation, we can start by multiplying both sides by z:
z*(z^-1 - z^2) = i(z*(z^-1 + z^2)).
This simplifies to:
z^-1 - z^3 = i(z^-1 + z^3).
We can then multiply both sides by z^3:</description>

      <description>The correct statement(s) about polymers is (A) The polymerization of chloroprene gives natural rubber, and (D) Ethene at 350-570 K temperature and 1000-2000 atm pressure in the presence of a peroxide initiator yields high density polythene.
The polymerization of chloroprene (2-chlorobutadiene) does indeed give natural rubber, which is a type of elastomer. This process involves the addition polymerization of chloroprene monomers to form a polymer with a cis-1,4 configuration.
Ethene (ethylene) can also be polymerized to form high density polyethylene (HDPE) using a peroxide initiator at high temperatures and pressures.</description>

      <description>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of molality, which is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solvent. The molality of a solution is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.
In this case, the molality of the solution is 0.1 mol/1.8 kg = 0.0556 mol/kg. Since the salt remains 90% dissociated in the solution, this means that 0.9 × 0.</description>

      <description>To solve this problem, we can use the solubility equilibrium expression for PbSO4:
[Pb2+][SO4^2-] = Ksp
We can also use the dissociation constants for sulfuric acid to write the equilibrium expressions for H2SO4 and SO4^2-:
H2SO4 &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; H^+ + HSO4^- Ka1 = [H^+][HSO4^-]/[H2SO4]
HSO4^- &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; H^+ + SO4^2- Ka2 = [H^+][SO4^2-]/[HSO4^-]
We know that the concentration of H2SO4 is 1 M, and the concentration of Na2SO4 is 1.8 × 10^-2 M.</description>

      <description>The electrochemical extraction of aluminum from bauxite ore involves the electrolysis of Al2O3 mixed with Na3AlF6 to give Al and CO2. This process is known as the Hall-Héroult process.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a step-by-step explanation of the process:
Bauxite ore, which is a mixture of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and other minerals, is mined from the earth.
The bauxite ore is crushed and ground into a fine powder, called alumina.
The alumina is dissolved in hot aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form a solution called aluminate.</description>

      <description>To solve this problem, you need to first determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between Cu(NO3)2 and KI. You can do this by examining the reactants and products and considering the types of ions present.
The reactants are Cu(NO3)2 and KI, which contain the ions Cu2+, NO3-, K+, and I-. The products are a brown solution and a precipitate. The brown solution likely contains Cu2+ ions, and the precipitate likely contains I- ions.</description>

      <description>The pH of a solution prepared by mixing 0.01 mol each of H2CO3, NaHCO3, Na2CO3, and NaOH in 100 mL of water can be determined by calculating the concentrations of the various species present in the solution.
The initial concentrations of the various species present in the solution can be calculated as follows:
• H2CO3: 0.01 M • NaHCO3: 0.01 M • Na2CO3: 0.01 M • NaOH: 0.01 M
The equilibrium concentrations of the species present in the solution can then be determined.</description>

      <description>The standard molar enthalpy of formation of HgO(s) at 298 K (X) can be calculated using Hess&amp;rsquo;s law of constant heat summation. This law states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is independent of the pathway taken to reach the reaction. Therefore, the enthalpy change of any reaction can be calculated by adding the enthalpy changes of the individual reactions which make up the overall reaction.
In this case, the reaction of combustion of Hg(g) to form HgO(s) can be broken down into two individual reactions as follows:</description>
